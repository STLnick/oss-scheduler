OS Project 3
Operating System Simulator - Scheduler

Version Control:
GitHub repo: https://github.com/STLnick/oss-scheduler


To run the program:
First run 'make' to build 'oss' and 'user_proc'

Run command example:
./oss

* NO options are used in execution.
* Use -h to get a basic description of the program

What Works:
- OSS 'schedules' a process through the message queue
- All logging messages are written at proper times
- Shared clock is incremented properly and used in logging messages
- Setup the shared memory for PCB array

What Doesn't Work:
- Signal handling
- Termination criteria -> just runs a hard coded loop, doesn't take into account 3 seconds elapsed or number of processes ran
- Queues -> logging messages mention queues but were never actually setup
- Multi-level feedback queue structure as a whole
- No statistics logged
- Not using the setup PCB array to track statistics
